"""Elpy backend using native Python methods.

This backend does not use any external packages, so should work even
if only the core Python library is available. This does make it
somewhat limited compared to the other backends.

On the other hand, this backend also serves as a root class for the
other backends, so they can fall back to the native method if the
specific solutions do not work.
